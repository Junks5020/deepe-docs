# Training Jobs

The **Training Jobs** module in DeepExtension allows users to fine-tune language models through a fully visual, no-code interface. It supports various 
fine-tuning strategies, integrates seamlessly with your datasets, and provides transparent monitoring and comparison tools throughout the training 
lifecycle.

> Most of these parameters are passed directly to your training logic. To customize their use, refer to [Implement Your Own Training](../developer/implement-own-ai-training-cuda.md).


Once you click **"Run the Train"**, the job will be submitted and processed in **background mode** on your backend infrastructure.

## View Train Details & Monitor Progress

To inspect an existing training job:

1. Go to the **Model Training** main page.
2. Click **"View Details"** on a training job.

You will see three tabs:

- **Train Overview**: Shows all training parameters used
- **Evaluation Data**: Real-time visualizations of loss curves, reward scores, and performance metrics
- **Train Log**: Raw logs generated during training for debugging or auditing

---

## Copy a Train

To quickly replicate and tweak a previous training job:

1. While viewing a training job’s **Train Overview** tab, scroll to the bottom.
2. Click **"Copy the Train"**.
3. This will pre-fill the new job form with the exact same configuration — allowing you to make minimal changes (e.g., dataset or learning rate) and run 
a comparable training job immediately.

This is ideal for A/B testing or iterative improvements.

## Training Comparison

You can compare multiple training jobs side-by-side:

- Select any two or more jobs on the main page
- Click **"Compare"** to see configuration, performance metrics, and outcomes all in one view
