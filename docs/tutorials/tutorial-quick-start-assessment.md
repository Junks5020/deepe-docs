# Quick Start: Model Evaluation with Vision Models and Multi-Image Comparison Datasets

## 1. Prepare Your Dataset
- Download sample dataset:
  - Location: [`Tutorials → Quick Start → Run Your First Training`](tutorial-quick-start.md)
- Or use custom dataset:
  - Format requirements: Follow [`User Guide → Dataset Management → Multimodal Datasets` ](../user-guide/dataset-management.md)specifications
> Tips:  
  >  Our dataset features paired original and modified images (*generated by Black Forest Labs*) with corresponding annotations and `generation` prompts in the generation field.

## 2. Upload Dataset
1. Log in to DeepExtension platform
2. Navigate to `Dataset Management` page
3. Click `Upload Dataset` button
4. Select prepared dataset file
5. Click `Submit` and check the result

## 3. Create Evaluation Task
1. Go to `Model Evaluation` page
2. Click `New Evaluation Task`

### Configuration:
- **Evaluation Mode**: Select `Referee Model Mode`
- **Dataset**: Choose uploaded multimodal dataset
- **Model Selection**:
    - Model A
    - Model B 
    - Referee Model (for judgment)

- **Prompt Configuration**:
    - User prompt (example):
      ```text
      Compare these two images and describe the differences
      ```
    - Ensure both image placeholders are included
    - Use identical/similar content for referee prompt

## 4. Preview & Submit
1. You can click `Preview` to verify configuration
2. If you are satisfy with the preview information,you can confirm settings and click `Submit Evaluation`
3. You can monitor progress via logs section

## 5. Analyze Results
1. Click `View Results` after completion
2. Key sections:
    - **Parameter Details**: Verify configuration
    - **System Logs**: Check execution records
    - **Result Comparison**: Analyze model outputs and referee feedback

3. Available actions:
    - Download CSV results (from list page)

## Quick Testing Tips
1. Access `DeepText` feature
2. Workflow:
    - Select vision-language model
    - Upload two comparison images
    - Enter prompt (e.g., "Describe image differences")

3. View real-time model inferences

## Important Notes
1. Token usage: Preview helps avoid waste
2. Image format: Ensure platform compatibility
3. Referee model: Recommended to be stronger than test models
